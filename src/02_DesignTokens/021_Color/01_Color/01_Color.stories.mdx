<h1>Color Design Tokens</h1>
<p>Design tokens are design decisions, represented as data, that ensure systematically unified and 
    cohesive product experiences. On this page you will find example color design tokens to be used 
    within the design system. Extra rules, best practices and examples of how color should and 
    should not be used can also be added to this page as the desgin system develops and these decions 
    have been made to aid designers making future design decions for components within the system.</p>
